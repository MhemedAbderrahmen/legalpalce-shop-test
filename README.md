# Shop Test App

## Objective
The goal of this test is to assess your React skills, including state management, component architecture, TypeScript, and unit testing. You are expected to complete the functionality, refactor the code, and add appropriate unit tests.

## Task
1. **Complete the Shop Functionality:**
   - When logged in, display the list of items dynamically using the mock API (`mockFetchData`).
   - Allow users to add items to the cart.
   - Display the cart items in the "Cart" section.
   - Enable removing items from the cart.
   - Calculate and display the total price in the cart.

2. **Refactor the Code:**
   - Apply best practices for component architecture.
   - Avoid unnecessary re-renders using React hooks effectively.
   - Ensure the code is clean, modular, and maintainable.

3. **Add Unit Tests:**
   - Use a testing framework of your choice (e.g., Jest, React Testing Library, or Cypress).
   - Cover critical functionality such as login, item addition, cart management, and price calculation.

## Instructions
1. Clone the repository.
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
3. Start the development server:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```
4. Implement the required features and refactor the code.
5. Write unit tests and ensure they pass.
6. Provide a summary of your changes and any relevant information in the `SUMMARY.md` file.

## Evaluation Criteria
- Code quality and readability.
- Proper use of React hooks and state management.
- Completeness and accuracy of the required features.
- Testing coverage and quality of test cases.
- Code refactoring and best practices.

Good luck!
